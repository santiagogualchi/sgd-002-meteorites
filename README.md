# Meteorite Landings

This is a subproject of
**[@santigualchi.data](https://www.instagram.com/santigualchi.data/)**.

## About the project

**santigualchi.data** is a personal project where I apply my professional skills
and favorite data science tools to explore topics that interest me. On my
Instagram account,
**[@santigualchi.data](https://www.instagram.com/santigualchi.data/)**,
I showcase the results of this project, transforming raw data into compelling
stories.

But that's not all. Each story is developed according to
**[Serious Data Science](https://posit.co/blog/driving-real-lasting-value-with-serious-data-science/)**
principles, and all the code used to generate each slide is publicly available
in separate repositories. This way, anyone interested can examine the code and
learn from it.

## Project status

The Instagram account has been created but it'll remain private until
sgd-001-happiness and
[sgd-002-meteorites](https://github.com/santiagogualchi/sgd-002-meteorites) are
completed. After launching the Instagram account, posts will be done in a
monthly basis.

## Description

**TO BE COMPLETED**

## Data

The data for this project was web-scraped from the
[Meteoritical Bulletin Database](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/). As I do not
intend to share this data or the means to obtain it without authorization by
the Meteoritical Society, I'm including an alternative dataset that is publicly
available. This dataset is not as up-to-date as the web-scraped version, but is
fully compatible with the project's code.
