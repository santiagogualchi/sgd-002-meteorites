# Meteorite Landings

This is a subproject of
**[@santigualchi.data](https://www.instagram.com/santigualchi.data/)**. To find

## Description

**TO BE COMPLETED**

## Data

The data for this project was web-scraped from the
[Meteoritical Bulletin Database](https://www.lpi.usra.edu/meteor/). As I do not
intend to share this data or the means to obtain it without authorization by
the Meteoritical Society, I'm including an alternative dataset that is publicly
available. This dataset is not as up-to-date as the web-scraped version, but is
fully compatible with the project's code.
